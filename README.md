# graphql-federation-example
An example for GraphQl Federation

To run, follow these steps:
    1. Navigate inside a subfolder (user-service)
    2. Open a cmd/bash here
    3. Do a npm install here
    4. After step 3 completes, run 'npm start' to start the service

  Repeat above 4 steps for other two services as well.

When everything finshes, you can query the complete Service at http://localhost:4000/

If you wish to query the individual graph for the two services (user-service, tweet-service), check your console logs to find the server urls there.

Enjoy!
